# WRF_Post_MFLUX
- This Folder contains the code to compute the Vertically Integrated Moisture flux using WRF model output data using NCL.
- I am only uploading my current python codes (one can find the Python codes under **SRB_MFC_WRF_Python** directory), because I am currently working on creating a Python based toolbax for computing and plotting Vertically Integrated Moisture fluxes usning Xarray and Dask python libraries.
- The user will be able to plot overlayed contours, vector plots, horizontal and vertical cross section plots.
- I will be providing **ImageMagick** routines for manipulation of plots for scientifc publications.
