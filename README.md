# WRF_Post_MFLUX
This Folder contains the code to compute the Vertically Integrated Moisture flux using WRF model output data.
I am currently working on creating a Python based toolbax for computing and plotting Vertically Integrated Moisture fluxes usning Xarray and Dask python libraries.
The user will be able to plot overlayed contours, vector horizontal as well as vertical cross section plots.
